# React Starter Kit

To install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.

To build the static files:

```js
npm run build
```


To run tests in Node:

```js
npm test
```
  * a brief overview of the project
  * images of both the original comp and your version
  * a reflection on what was challenging, any lightbulb moments you had, and your biggest takeaways
- Stretch goal: Comp should be fully responsive
- Stretch goal: Push your final work to github pages (you will have to run a build and push the main.bundle.js file to github)


### Additional Requirements
- This challenge will be a part of your mod 2 portfolio
